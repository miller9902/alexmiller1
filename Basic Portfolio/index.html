					I was born in Plano, Texas on January 12th 1995. I resided in McKinney, Texas for most of my life and attended Mckinney Boyd High School. After graduation I went on to attend the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville. After 4 incredible years, I graduated with a degree in finance and was forced to find a real job. I now work as a Buyer at Fujitsu in Richardson, Texas.

					During my first couple months at my full time job I quickly realized I could not do this long term. I did a lot of research on what kind of jobs I would enjoy, would give me more freedom, and would keep me finacially stable. Based on those ideas, I quickly stumbled on to coding. I immediatly started practicing and looking more into it. I found the SMU code bootcamp, and figured this was my best shot to get into the field, so here I am!
